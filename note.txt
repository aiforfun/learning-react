Which Components Should Be Stateful?
Recognizing which components should own state is often the most challenging part for React newcomers to understand. When in doubt, follow this four-step checklist. For each piece of state in your application,
• Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
• Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components
that need the state in the hierarchy).
• Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
• If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component simply to hold the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
